; Exercise 129
; Create BSL lists that represent
; a list of celestial bodies, say, at least all the planets in our solar system;
; a list of items for a meal, for example, steak, french fries, beans, bread, water, Brie cheese, and ice cream; and
; a list of colors.

; Sketch some box representations of these lists, similar to those in figures 44 and 45.
; Which of the sketches do you like better?

; I like the boxes-in-boxes picture when depicting a single list.

; I like the boxes-and-arrows picture if multiple lists share a particular cons. For example:
; (define anchor (cons 'stake '()))
; (define first-rope (cons 'segment1 anchor))
; (define second-rope (cons 'segmen2 anchor))
; ___________|cons|  ___________|cons| 
; |first     |rest|  |first     |rest|
; |----------|----|  |----------|----|
; | segment1 |  o-|->| 'stake   |'() |
; |---------------|  |---------------|
;                    ^
; ___________|cons|  |
; |first     |rest|  |

; A 3LON is a list of three numbers:
;   (cons Number (cons Number (cons Number '())))
; interpretation:
;   a point in 3-dimensional space

; A List-of-names is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons String List-of-names)
; interpretation:
;   a list of invitees, by last name

; Exercise 130
; Create an element of List-of-names that contains five Strings.
; Sketch a box representation of the list similar to those found in figure 44.

; Explain why
;   (cons "1" (cons "2" '()))
; is an element of List-of-names and why
;   (cons 2 '())
; isnâ€™t.

; claim: (cons "1" (cons "2" '()))
; argument:
; a. '() is a List-of-names by the first clause in the itemization.
; b. (cons "2" '()) is a List-of-names by the second clause in the itemization; for,
;      "2" is a String and '() is an element of List-of-names by (a).
; c. (cons "1" (cons "2" '())) is a List-of-names by the second clause in the itemization; for,
;    "1" is a String and (cons "2" '()) is a List-of-names by (b).

; claim: (cons 2 '()) is not an element of List-of-names
; argument:
; (cons 2 '()) is not '(), so (cons "2" '()) fails to be a List-of-names by the first clause in the itemization.
; a. '() is a List-of-names by the first clause in the itemization.
; b. 2 is a Number; it is not a String. So, (cons 2 '()) fails to match the pattern (cons String List-of-names).

; Exercise 131
; Provide a data definition for representing lists of Boolean values.
; The class contains all arbitrarily long lists of Booleans.

; A List-of-booleans is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons Boolean List-of-booleans)
