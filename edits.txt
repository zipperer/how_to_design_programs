```
(define WIDTH-OF-WORLD 200)
 
(define WHEEL-RADIUS 5)
(define WHEEL-DISTANCE (* WHEEL-RADIUS 5))
Note how the second constant is computed from the first.
```

Could define WHEEL-RADIUS using WIDTH-OF-WORLD.

The line `Note how the second constant is computed from the first.` is a little confusing b/c there are three constants, and the third is computed from the second, rather than the second from the first.

door-closer uses string=?

(define (door-closer state-of-door)
  (cond
    [(string=? LOCKED state-of-door) LOCKED]
    [(string=? CLOSED state-of-door) CLOSED]
    [(string=? OPEN state-of-door) CLOSED]))

The values in DoorState are symbolic -- LOCKED, CLOSED, OPEN.

I claim door-closer should use equal? rather than string=?, since
the states are symbolic and the string value is an implementation detail.

Before the section with door-closer, an example uses equal? and has Aside:
```
The equal? function in figure 27 compares two arbitrary values, 
regardless of what these values are. 
Equality is a complicated topic in the world of programming.
```

That section includes a warning about relying on implementation details:
```
Figure 27 displays two different functions that switch the state of a traffic light in a simulation program. Which of the two is properly designed using the recipe for itemization? Which of the two continues to work if you change the constants to the following
(define RED "red")
(define GREEN "green")
(define YELLOW "yellow")

```

Exercise 65 gives only the box type and field names.
Solving exercise 66 gives concrete instances of structure types.
