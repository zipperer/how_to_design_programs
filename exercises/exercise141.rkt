; Exercise 141
; If you are asked to design the function cat, which consumes a list of strings and appends them all into one long string,
; you are guaranteed to end up with this partial definition:

; List-of-string -> String
; concatenates all strings in l into one long string

Figure 57: A table for cat
|#

;Fill in the table in figure 57.
;Guess a function that can create the desired result from the values computed by the sub-expressions.

;Use DrRacketâ€™s stepper to evaluate (cat (cons "a" '())). 

; A List-of-strings is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons String List-of-strings)
; <arrow from List-of-strings in second clause to List-of-strings in data definition first line>

; List-of-strings -> String
; make one string from elements in input list
; append all strings together in order
