; Exercise 70
; Spell out the laws for these structure type definitions:

(define-struct centry [name home office cell])

; laws of computation for centry:
; (centry-name (make-centry n0 h0 o0 c0)) == n0
; (centry-home (make-centry n0 h0 o0 c0)) == h0
; (centry-office (make-centry n0 h0 o0 c0)) == o0
; (centry-office (make-centry n0 h0 o0 c0)) == c0

(define-struct phone [area number])

; laws of computation for phone
; (phone-area (make-phone a0 n0)) == a0
; (phone-number (make-phone a0 n0)) == n0

; Use DrRacketâ€™s stepper to confirm 101 as the value of this expression:
(phone-area
 (centry-office
  (make-centry "Shriram Fisler"
    (make-phone 207 "363-2421")
    (make-phone 101 "776-1099")
    (make-phone 208 "112-9981"))))
