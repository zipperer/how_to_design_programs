; Exercise 39.
;  Good programmers ensure that an image such as CAR can be enlarged or reduced via a single change to a constant definition.
;
;  Good programmers establish a single point of control for all aspects of their programs, not just the graphical constants.
;  Several chapters deal with this issue.
;
;  We started the development of our car image with a single plain definition:
;    (define WHEEL-RADIUS 5)
;
;  The definition of WHEEL-DISTANCE is based on the wheelâ€™s radius.
;  Hence, changing WHEEL-RADIUS from 5 to 10 doubles the size of the car image.
;  This kind of program organization is dubbed single point of control, and good design employs this idea as much as possible.
;  Develop your favorite image of an automobile so that WHEEL-RADIUS remains the single point of control.
