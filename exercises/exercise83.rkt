; for hypothesis, see exercise84:
; '''
; equality between editors with equal fields fails without the define-struct form here
; (equal? (make-editor "a" "a") (make-editor "a" "a")) succeeds when define-struct is here and fails when define-struct comes from (require ...)
; I hypothesize that I need to (provide ...) another function, e.g. something like editor-equal?

; Exercise 83
; Design the function render, which consumes an Editor and produces an image.

; The purpose of the function is to render the text within an empty scene of 200x20 pixels.
; For the cursor, use a 1x20 red rectangle and for the strings, black text of size 16.

; Develop the image for a sample string in DrRacketâ€™s interactions area. We started with this expression:
; (overlay/align "left" "center"
;               (text "hello world" 11 "black")
;               (empty-scene 200 20))

; You may wish to read up on beside, above, and such functions.
; When you are happy with the looks of the image, use the expression as a test and as a guide to the design of render.
